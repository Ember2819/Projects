    <div id="verse1">
      (15) He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.<br>
      (16) For by Him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by Him and for Him.
    </div>
    <div id="verse2">
      (26) Lift up your eyes on high and see: Who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of His might and because He is strong in power, not one is missing.<br>
      (28) Have you not known? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; His understanding is unsearchable.
    </div>
    <div id="verse3">
      (1) In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>
      (2) The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.<br>
      (3) And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.<br>
      (4) And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.<br>
      (5) God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
    </div>
    <div id="verse4">
      (26) Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
    </div>
    <div id="verse5">
      (1) When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless,
      (2) that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.”<br>
      (3) Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him,<br>
      (4) “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations."
    </div>
    <div id="verse6">
      (12) And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,<br>
      (13) “You shall observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall be put to death.<br>
      (14) You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy to you."
    </div>
    <div id="verse7">
      (1) Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br>
      (2) And on the seventh day God finished His work that He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work that He had done.<br>
      (3) So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all His work that He had done in creation.
    </div>
    <div id="verse8">
      (23) And Adam said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”
      (24) Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
    </div>
    <div id="verse9">
      (13) “You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve Him and hold fast to Him, and by His name you shall swear.<br>
      (14) You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are around you—<br>
      (15) for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God—lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you."
    </div>
    <div id="verse10">
      (19) Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits, the God of our salvation!<br>
      (20) He is our God, the God of salvation; and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death.
    </div>
    <div id="verse11">
      (14) So the LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.<br>
      (15) I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."
    </div>
    <div id="verse12">
      (7) “If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”
      (8) Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
    </div>
    <div id="verse13">
      (5) “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and He shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.<br>
      (6) In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is His name by which He will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’”
    </div>
    <div id="verse14">
      (1) A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.<br>
      (2) Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting You are God.<br>
      (3) You return man to dust and say, “Return, O children of man!”<br>
      (4) For a thousand years in Your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.
    </div>
    <div id="verse15">
      (1) This is the book of the genealogy of Adam.<br>
      (2) When God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.<br>
      (3) Male and female He created them, and He blessed them and named them Man when they were created.
